Actually i want to add salery tab this in Member detail 

Salery Defination Tab 

Each Farm Member have Salery Tab Like this 
Basic Salery  --- Some Amount
Housing Allownce --- Some Amount
Other Allownce --- Some Amount & duration(daily, Monthly, Yearly)
( Farm admin can add many Allowance as he wants and will be added to farm member salery as per  allowance frequency let assume he add food allownce 100  daily then it should be add in his monthly salery with 3000)

Employe Joining Date ----- so later we can calulate his salery balance 

Total Salary for the Employee (sum up of all the above Basic salary with all allowances which defined)

add another tab Salery Transaction Tab

So now Farm admin will add salery Transaction to a farm member based on this we need to calulate the salery status for this employee
